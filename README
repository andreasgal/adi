This collection of scripts fetch ADI data for Desktop and Android Firefox and do some analysis over the date. Amongst others the Year-over-Year delta to the previous year is calculated on a daily, 7-daily, 30-daily and 90-daily basis to smooth the data.

If you find any mistakes in the ADI fetching or analysis, please send a pull request.
